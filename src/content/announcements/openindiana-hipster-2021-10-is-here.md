Another 6 months have passed, and we are proud to announce the release of our 2021.10 snapshot. The images are available at the usual place. As usual, we have automatically received all updates that have been integrated into illumos-gate.

The new images are interesting for people with newer hardware that hasn’t been supported in the past. There is no necessity to re-install from newer images as OpenIndiana Hipster is a rolling release and will bring all updates with a simple call of 
```
pfexec pkg update -v
```

More details will follow when time permits…
